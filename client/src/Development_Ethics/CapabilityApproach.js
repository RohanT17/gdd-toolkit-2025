      <h1>What is the Capability Approach?</h1>
      <p>
        The Capability Approach is a theoretical framework for assessing and evaluating individual well-being and social arrangements, developed by economist and philosopher Amartya Sen. It emphasizes the importance of individuals' capabilities—their real freedoms or opportunities to achieve the kind of lives they value.
      </p>
      <h2>Key Concepts of the Capability Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Capabilities:</strong> The various combinations of functionings (beings and doings) that a person can achieve.</li>
        <li><strong>Functionings:</strong> The actual achievements of an individual, such as being healthy, being educated, or participating in community life.</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom:</strong> The real opportunities or choices available to individuals to pursue their own goals and values.</li>
        <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Recognizing that individuals have different needs, preferences, and circumstances that affect their capabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Applications of the Capability Approach</h2>
      <p>
        The Capability Approach has been widely applied in various fields, including development economics, social policy, and human rights. It provides a more comprehensive understanding of poverty and inequality by focusing on what individuals are able to do and be, rather than solely on income or resources. This approach has influenced the design of development programs and policies aimed at enhancing people's capabilities and improving their quality of life.
