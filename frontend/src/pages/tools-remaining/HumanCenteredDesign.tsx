           There are several factors that must be taken into consideration during the process of designing, including its functionalities, end-users, and general usability. 
           However, designers occasionally their own experiences and insights, in turn influencing the way these factors are taken into account. 
           To develop a truly useful and inclusive toolkit, it is necessary to take into consideration the design choices' effects on all sorts of end-users and ensure that the resulting product benefits everyone fairly.

           Even when it is not feasible to predict the needs of all potential users, efforts must be made to create the design as user-friendly and inclusive as it possibly can. 
           The conceptualization of development ethics prompts us to ask whether or not our design decisions directly address the needs of the user or only our own presumptions. 
           Human-centered design facilitates it to ask such questions by prioritizing empathy, feedback, and collaboration among designers and their potential beneficiaries in the entire process of development. 
           One approach that effectively ensures that the toolkit is meaningful and useful as well as accessible by design to the user is Stanford’s iterative 5-step d.school model: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.

            <b>Human-Centered Design (HCD)</b> is an approach to creating projects, products, and policies that starts with people and stays with them throughout the entire design process.

            In practice, this means that once a problem is identified, designers begin by learning directly from the people affected. 
            Through conversations, observations, and other forms of engagement, they surface real needs, everyday challenges, and existing strengths. These insights shape how the problem is framed and what directions are explored.
             As ideas are generated and tested, community members continue to react, critique, and co-create, helping refine solutions so they are understandable, usable, and genuinely helpful.

            Done well, HCD can make material more accessible, build trust, and create a sense of shared ownership over the outcome. 
            It doesn’t guarantee perfect solutions, but it does ensure that people’s voices, contexts, and constraints are central rather than an afterthought.

            <b>Development ethics</b> deepens human-centered design by asking not only “Is this desirable and usable?” but also “Is this just, dignifying, and genuinely worthwhile for people’s lives?” 
            While HCD focuses on understanding users’ experiences and designing with them, development ethics raises questions about power, agency, justice, and long-term well-being. 
            It asks who defines the “problem,” who benefits, who bears the risks, and whose voices are missing. 
            By combining HCD with development ethics, practitioners move beyond creating solutions that are merely efficient or appealing and instead design projects, programs, and policies that expand 
            people’s capabilities, respect their autonomy, and avoid reproducing harm or inequality. 
            In this toolkit, development ethics is not an add-on—it is the lens that shapes every stage of the HCD process.
