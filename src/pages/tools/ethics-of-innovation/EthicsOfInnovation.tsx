                        By utilizing the 9 principles of digital design: contrast, movement, repetition, proportion, balance, emphasis, 
                        simplicity, functionality, accessibility, and incorporating ethics of innovation, you can effectively lead a 
                        project as a program manager in this simulation. In this role, you’ll have to decide how best to design you 
                        project while keeping ethics of innovation in mind! Try it out for yourself.
